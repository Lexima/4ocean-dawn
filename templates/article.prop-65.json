However, Prop 65 requires companies to warn consumers about the potential for exposure unless the company can demonstrate that exposure causes “no significant risk,” which means that the exposure levels must be at least 1,000 times less than the scientifically-established safe level. <\/p><p>Unfortunately, the process to prove that this is the case can be difficult and costly, especially on a per product basis. So in the interest of full transparency and cost effectiveness (we want as many dollars going back into our cleanups as possible), we decided not to pursue certification and instead will include this warning label on all 4ocean products that contain our plant-based epoxy resin, which contains extremely trace amounts of BPA that are barely detectable and well under the Prop 65 threshold.<\/p><p>Please <a href=\"https:\/\/oehha.ca.gov\/proposition-65\/general-info\/current-proposition-65-no-significant-risk-levels-nsrls-maximum\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">visit the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) website<\/span><\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.p65warnings.ca.gov\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">go to P65warnings.ca.gov<\/span><\/a> to learn more about Prop 65.<\/p>"
