Today, as much as 80% of the world’s fisheries are either overfished or collapsing.It’s estimated that approximately170 billion pounds of wildlife are removed from the ocean by fishers each year.Scientists fear that continuing to fish at our current rate will cause a full-scale collapse of the world’s fisheries which would have a significant impact on global food security.<\/p>",
